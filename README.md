## Thurs/Friday Activity - REST

This activity is an introduction to REST-based architecture. It is all about creating posts and ways to add, view, edit, and delete them. This is done with the help of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE as well as HTTP dependencies.

## Models

# post.model.dart

### Utils

# http_service.dart
# post_card.dart
# post_controller.dart

# Contributions
The following is the list of contributions of each group member:
1. Lara Grace Riconalla 
- See all posts (Show a summary card instead  of all the data (GET /posts))
- See the details of a specific post
Show a detailed view via modal or a different screen (GET /posts/id)

2. Maricor Masong
- Add a new post and see it in the overall list (POST /posts) 
- Delete a post (resource will not be really updated on the server but it will be faked as if) therefore find a way to make it seem as if it was added in the UI
- Edit a post (PUT) (resource will not be really updated on the server but it will be faked as if) therefore find a way to make it seem as if it was added in the UI
- Delete a post (resource will not be really updated on the server but it will be faked as if) therefore find a way to make it seem as if it was deleted in the UI

3. Isabelle Isidro
